Ideation: 

With the volatility of cryptocurrency, I want to provide a way for investors to project their risk and determine what’s a good time to perform any action that they’re currently thinking of related to the cryptocurrency that they own.

The user would be able to select a cryptocurrency and then after processing with machine learning and other prediction tools, we’ll be able to show them a graph indicating the performance of their cryptocurrency.

I’ll be using an API to pull information related to a cryptocurrency. The history of that cryptocurrency will be downloaded and used to provide the appropriate predictions for the selected cryptocurrency on the web app.
